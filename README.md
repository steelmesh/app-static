# Steelmesh Static Application Example

This is a simple static (client-side only) application example that demonstrates the absolute simplest use case of Steelmesh.  It is, in reality, something that is better suited to a standard [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org/) but if you are using Steelmesh for distributing Node applications and have a requirement to build a simple static site, then you can.
